# simple-js-pokedex

This is a simple JavaScript 'pokedex' application. It uses data from an external API and it displays different pokemon names.

You can navigate through it by clicking the buttons or by searching the pokemon's name.

If the button is clicked it will display a modal window with a front facing picture and some details for that specific pokemon.
